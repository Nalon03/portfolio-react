# üóìÔ∏è 3-Week Full-Stack Developer Portfolio Plan

## Week 1: Frontend - Foundation and Core Pages

### Day 1: Project Setup & Basic Layout
- Set up a new React project (using Create React App, Vite, or Next.js).
- Install Tailwind CSS and configure it in your project.
- Create the basic folder structure in your `client` directory: `components`, `pages`, `styles`, `utils`.
- Create a basic `Navbar` component (placeholder links for now).
- Create a basic `Footer` component (social links placeholder, copyright).

### Day 2: Home Page - Hero Section
- Create the `Home` page component in the `pages` directory.
- Implement the Hero section: your name, a short introductory headline, and a compelling call to action (e.g., "View My Projects").
- Style the Hero section using Tailwind CSS to make it visually appealing and responsive.

### Day 3: Home Page - Intro Section & Basic Styling
- Add an "Introduction" section to the Home page below the Hero.
- Write a brief introduction about yourself and your background.
- Continue styling the Home page using Tailwind CSS. Focus on layout and basic typography.

### Day 4: About Me Page - Skills Section
- Create the `AboutMe` page component.
- Implement the "Skills" section, listing your key technical skills (e.g., React, Node.js, etc.).
- Style the Skills section using Tailwind CSS, perhaps using a grid or list format.

### Day 5: About Me Page - Experience & Tech Stack
- Add "Experience" section to the AboutMe page, outlining your relevant work or project experience.
- Create a "Tech Stack" section (can be combined with Skills or separate) to visually showcase the technologies you use. Consider using icons for popular technologies.
- Style these sections using Tailwind CSS.

## Week 2: Frontend - Projects and Contact

### Day 6: Projects Page - Basic Layout & ProjectCard
- Create the `Projects` page component.
- Build the basic layout for the project gallery.
- Create a reusable `ProjectCard` component to display individual projects (include placeholders for image, title, description).

### Day 7: Projects Page - Project Data & Display
- Create a `data` folder or a simple array within your Projects page to hold your project information (title, description, image URL, etc.).
- Map through this data to dynamically render multiple `ProjectCard` components on the Projects page.
- Implement basic styling for the project cards and the overall gallery layout using Tailwind CSS.

### Day 8: Contact Page - Form Structure
- Create the `Contact` page component.
- Implement a basic contact form with fields for name, email, and message.
- Style the form using Tailwind CSS.

### Day 9: Contact Page - Form Validation & Basic Styling
- Implement basic client-side form validation for the Contact page (e.g., checking for required fields and valid email format). You can use built-in HTML5 validation or a library like React Hook Form.
- Continue styling the Contact page and form elements.

### Day 10: Frontend Polish & Responsiveness
- Review all the frontend pages (Home, About Me, Projects, Contact) for visual consistency and polish.
- Ensure that the layout is responsive across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using Tailwind CSS's responsive utilities.

### Day 11: Backend Setup (Node.js/NestJS)
- Set up a new Node.js or NestJS project in a `server` directory at the root of your project.
- Install necessary dependencies (e.g., Express or NestJS core libraries).
- If using a database, choose one (MongoDB or PostgreSQL) and install the corresponding driver (e.g., mongoose for MongoDB, pg for PostgreSQL).

### Day 12: Backend - /api/contact Endpoint
- Create a route and controller (or equivalent in your chosen backend framework) to handle form submissions to the `/api/contact` endpoint.
- Implement logic to receive the form data from the frontend and potentially store it in your database or send it via email.

### Day 13: Deployment - Frontend
- Create an account on a platform like Vercel or Netlify (for frontend hosting).
- Follow their instructions to connect your Git repository and deploy your React frontend.

### Day 14: Deployment - Backend (Optional)
- Create an account on a platform like Render, Railway, or a VPS (for backend hosting).
- Follow their instructions to deploy your Node.js or NestJS backend. You might need to configure environment variables for your database connection.

### Day 15 (Optional): Enhancements & Testing
- Implement a dark mode toggle in your frontend.
- Add basic animations using Framer Motion or GSAP.
- Add a downloadable Resume page (this might just be a link to a PDF).
- Write basic unit tests for some frontend components.
